# loadingsection
Iâ€™ve created a loading section that appears before the site fully loads using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


I am passionate about creating web applications with programming skills in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js) and back-end development (Node.js, Express.js), I bring a well-rounded approach to every project. Proficient in using tools like VS Code and IntelliJ IDEA, and adept in Microsoft Office with advanced formula skills.
